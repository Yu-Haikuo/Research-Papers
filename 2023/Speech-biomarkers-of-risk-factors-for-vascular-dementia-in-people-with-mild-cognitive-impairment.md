> https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.1057578/full

## Short Summary

### Objective

Use speech analysis to analyze the cognitive impairments caused by pathologies of vascular origin like diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and heart disease, and find voice biomarkers related to those pathologies as predictors to predict vascular dementia.

### Methods

Let participants read certain contents and inquire certain questions --> record their voices --> analyze voice recordings

### Results

- Some speech parameters like frequencies and syllabic rhythm may vary due to the pathologies.
- Speech parameters can be used to predict many diseases.
    - Diabetes and hypertension can be predicted with accuracy of 95%.
    - Hypercholesterolemia and heart disease can be predicted with accuracy of 80%.

## Introduction

### Dementia

- Different types of dementia (like Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia) have overlap in neuropathological and neurochemical symptoms and they share several risk factors like age, hypertension, diabetes and obesity.
- Vascular dementia can occur on its own, but in practice it often comes with other neurodegenerative processes, resulting in **mixed dementia**.
- For vascular dementia there is no effective medications nowadays, so the main work is focusing on the **prevention**.

### Speech Analysis

- It is cost-effective, non-invasive and can be used on mobile devices.
- Most of the studies involving voice biomarkers focus on other types of dementia (like Alzheimer's disease), thus this study mainly focus on **vascular dementia**.
- This study will focus on observing the **changes in speech** produced by diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and heart disease.

### Existing Studies

- Existing studies between vascular aspects and speech analysis are few.
- Weakness and loss of muscle in vocal system may result in changes in producing voice, which may interference test accuracy. Thus, in this study the author was trying to avoid these factors.
- Some existing studies suggest that voice quality & rhythmic speech parameters are related to other cognitive domains like attention, memory or linguistic processes, and they could be affected by the dementia symptoms.
- The analysis of this study includes different elements of **rhythm**, **prosody** and **speech quality**.

## Methodology

### Participants

- A total of 40 people with mild cognitive impairment.
- Inclusion criteria:
    - native Spanish speakers
    - over 55 years old
    - have sufficient schooling
- Exclusion criteria:
    - personal history of central nervous system diseases, alcohol or substance abuse
    - presence of severe sensory deficits

### Dem-Detect Battery

- **Dem-Detect battery** was used to evaluate the participants.
- It contains Spanish version of Mini-Mental State Examination, Memory Impairment Screening, Free and Cued Reminding Test, Trail Making Test, Boston Naming Test, questionnaires for depression and assessment of activities of daily living.

### Audio Recordings

- Recordings were made using an iPad and a head-mounted condenser microphone.
- Recordings were analyzed with **Praat** software to obtain speech parameters including acoustic, rhythm and speech quality features.

### Test Procedure

- Total duration: about 1h.
- The session included anamnesis, assessment of cognitive and emotional status, and activities of daily living.
    - Anamnesis
        - ask different aspects of health condition
    - Assessment of cognitive and emotional status
        - let participants read certain text containing high and low frequency & familiarity terms together with syntactically complex sentences while recording their responses using an iPad.

### Statistical Analysis

It was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows.

## Results

The author selected 23 speech parameters and performed t-tests.

### Diabetes

Participants with diabetes tend to have significantly higher normalized **Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI)**.

> This is the average of the differences in duration between two successive syllabic intervals in the speech, divided by the sum of those intervals. A high nPVI value is related to greater rhythmic variability.

### Hypertension

Participants with high blood pressure tend to have significantly higher **F2**.

> As for hypertension, we found a higher F2, which may be related to the pressure exerted by the vessels of the vocal cords, leading to alterations in their vibration.
> 
> For the purposes of distinguishing vowels from each other, we are more interested in the frequency response curves (indicating the preferred resonating frequencies of the vocal tract) rather than in the raw spectrum of the wave. Each of the preferred resonanting frequencies of the vocal tract (each bump in the frequency response curve) is known as a formant. They are usually referred to as F1, F2, F3, etc. For example, the formants for a schwa as spoken by an adult male whose vocal tract is 17 centimetres long:
> 
> - F1 first formant 500 Hz
> - <ins>F2 second formant 1500 Hz</ins>
> - F3 third formant 2500 Hz

### Hypercholesterolemia

Participants with hypercholesterolemia tend to have significantly higher **H1 - H2**. Meanwhile, they also have shorter **syllable duration**.

> The acoustic measure H1–H2, also known as L1–L2 (Titze et al., 2015), refers to the difference in amplitude between the first and second harmonics. It is probably the most widely used voice quality measure in linguistic phonetic research and correlates with changes in phonation type (e.g., breathy vs modal vowels) in many languages (Esposito and Khan, 2020; Gordon and Ladefoged, 2001), as well as non-phonemic changes in phonation (Hanson et al., 2001; Li et al., 2020; Ní Chasaide and Gobl, 1993). In terms of aerodynamics, H1–H2 reflects the amount of airflow through the glottis (Sundberg and Gauffin, 1979); <ins>in terms of voice articulation, the measure is related to vocal fold (and, perhaps more broadly, laryngeal) constriction vs spreading</ins>. Generally, lower values of H1–H2 are associated with lower glottal open quotient (OQ), more constriction, and increased medial vocal fold thickness (Kreiman et al., 2012; Samlan and Story, 2011; Zhang, 2016b).

### Heart Disease

participants with heart disease tend to have significant higher **nPVI**.

## Discussion

### Findings

- Diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and heart disease have impacts on vocal performance.

### Strength

- This is the first study demonstrating changes to speech associated with hypercholesterolemia.
- Speech digital biomarkers found can be used to monitor risk factors of vascular dementia and set up an alert system.

### Limitations

- In Experiment:
    - The sample is small and the resulting groups for each condition are not equal.
    - In the case of heart disease and diabetes, the study did not consider specific diseases.
    - The comorbidity was not considered.
    - The text used in the experiment for the participants to read could be more phonetically balanced.
- In Application:
    - Speech production involves complex processes and thus, voice disturbances may be caused by a series of other conditions.
    - This study might not be generalizable to other population sectors, as targeting prevention of vascular dementia may take age and degree of cognitive impairment into account.
    - The clinical relevance of speech parameters might have to be compromised when applying on general population.

### Future Works

- Investigate the cognitive consequences of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and heart disease on speech and the mechanisms involved.
- Not only detect the risk factors of vascular dementia, but also search for its early indicators.
- Develop better classification tools involving status and severity, instead of just using presence or absence.
- Understand the underlying causes of speech changes and the mechanisms behind.
